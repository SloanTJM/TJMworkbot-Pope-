Read the file at operating_system/SEND_LEASE.md and complete the lease sending task with these details:

Property: Celina
Tenant: Christian Lachausse (read his contact details from the Excel Contracts sheet)
Lease terms:
- Month-to-month lease
- Mowing of yard included in base rent
- Utilities: Tenant will be invoiced monthly for actual utility bills after TJM receives them
- Use all of Christian's actual details (name, phone, etc.) from the Excel file

IMPORTANT: Override the email destination - send the lease to Sloan@tjmfuneral.com instead of Christian's email address for testing purposes.

This is a test run to verify the lease template and process before sending the actual lease to the tenant.
