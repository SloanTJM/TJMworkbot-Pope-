Send a test lease agreement for Christian Lachausse at the Celina property. Read the Excel file to get Christian's details from the Contracts sheet, then generate a rent house lease agreement with the following specifications:

- Tenant: Christian Lachausse (get rent amount and other details from Excel)
- Property: Celina property (get address from Properties sheet)
- Special terms: 
  * Mowing of yard included in base rent
  * Tenant will be invoiced for utility bills each month after we receive them
  * Month-to-month lease
- Send the lease to: Sloan@tjmfuneral.com (for testing purposes, not to the tenant's actual email)

Use the SEND_LEASE.md instructions and render the appropriate lease template with all the correct details from the Excel data, but override the email destination for testing.
