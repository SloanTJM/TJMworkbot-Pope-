Send a lease agreement for the Celina property rental. Read the Excel file to get Christian Lachausse's details and the Celina property information. Generate a rent house lease agreement with the following specifications:

- Tenant: Christian Lachausse 
- Property: Celina property (get address and rent amount from Excel)
- Special terms: Mowing of yard included in base rent, tenant will be invoiced monthly for utilities after bills are received, month-to-month lease
- **TEST OVERRIDE: Send the lease to Sloan@tjmfuneral.com instead of Christian's email address from the Excel file**

Use the rent house lease template since this is a residential property. All tenant details should reflect Christian's information from the Excel file, but route the email to the test address.
