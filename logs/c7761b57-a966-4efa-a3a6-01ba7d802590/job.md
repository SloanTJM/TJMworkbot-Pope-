Create a lease agreement for Christian Lachausse at the Celina property and send it as a test to Sloan@tjmfuneral.com instead of his actual email address.

Steps:
1. Read the TJM Real Estate Excel file to get Christian's details for the Celina property
2. Create a professional residential lease agreement with:
   - Christian Lachausse as tenant
   - Celina property address and details
   - Current rent amount ($1,800) and month-to-month terms
   - Mowing of yard included in base rent
   - Utilities: TJM will pay utility bills and invoice tenant monthly after receiving bills
   - Month-to-month lease agreement
   - Standard lease clauses for residential rental
   - TJM Real Estate as landlord
3. Generate the lease as a PDF document
4. Send the lease via email to Sloan@tjmfuneral.com with a subject line indicating it's a test lease for Christian/Celina
5. Include a note in the email that this is a test version for review

The lease should use Christian's actual information (name, property details, rent amount) but be sent to the test email address for review before sending the real version to Christian.
