Send a test lease agreement for the Celina property rental. Read the Excel file to get Christian Lachausse's details from the Celina property contract, then generate a rent house lease agreement with the following specifications:

- Tenant: Christian Lachausse (use his details from Excel)
- Property: Celina property 
- Send to: Sloan@tjmfuneral.com (testing email, not tenant's actual email)
- Special terms to include:
  - Mowing of yard included in base rent
  - Tenant will be invoiced monthly for utilities after TJM receives bills
  - Month-to-month lease agreement
- Use all other standard rent house lease terms

Read the Excel file operating_system/SEND_LEASE.md instructions and use the LEASE_RENT_HOUSE_TEMPLATE.html template. This is a test of the lease generation system before sending to the actual tenant.
