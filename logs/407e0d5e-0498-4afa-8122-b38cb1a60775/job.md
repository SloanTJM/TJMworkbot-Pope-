Check the TJM Real Estate invoicing schedule for the Celina property to determine when the next invoice will be sent out. Access the OneDrive Excel file at /Work/Real Estate/TJM_RENT_v2.xlsx using the graph-api skill, read the Contracts sheet to find the Celina property details (tenant: Christian Lachausse, $1,800 rent, month-to-month lease), check the billing cycle, due dates, and notification settings (Notify_Days field) to calculate when the next invoice will be automatically generated and sent.
